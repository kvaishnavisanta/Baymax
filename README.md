![Flowchart](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078212576879587370/1216993647271346226/baymaxxx-removebg-preview.png?ex=663135e8&is=662fe468&hm=b2a073f10ba5f89882569309a52e21e4d63833c70fc5030a23cae82b313458cb&)

This project presents a conversational chatbot with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5. The chatbot engages users in dynamic and friendly conversations, leveraging the powerful OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model for generating contextually relevant responses. Additionally, the application offers seamless conversation history management, allowing users to revisit and review past interactions.

## Key Features:

- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Harness the intelligence of the Hume ai model for generating natural and contextually appropriate responses.
- **Conversation History**: Seamlessly track and manage conversation history, facilitating continuity and context-aware dialogue.
- **Multithreading Support**: Experience smooth and responsive interactions with asynchronous message handling.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.7 or above
- EllEvenlabs for STT
- Hume Python SDK

## Problem Statment 
1. **Lack of Personalization**: The chatbot may struggle to provide personalized responses tailored to the user's preferences, leading to a generic and less engaging interaction.

2. **Limited Context Understanding**: Understanding the context of conversations can be challenging for chatbots, leading to misunderstandings or irrelevant responses.

3. **Emotional Intelligence**: Chatbots may lack emotional intelligence, making it difficult for them to understand and appropriately respond to the user's emotions, especially in sensitive situations.

4. **Maintaining Engagement**: Keeping users engaged over time can be difficult, as chatbots may struggle to provide fresh and interesting content or maintain continuity in conversations.

5. **Handling Complex Queries**: Chatbots may struggle to handle complex queries or tasks that require deep understanding or problem-solving skills beyond their programmed capabilities.
